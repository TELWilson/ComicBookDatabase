        <h2>History of Talisker</h2>
        <p>Talisker was founded by the MacAskill brothers, Hugh and Kenneth, in 1830 at Loch Harport.
            In 1857, Talisker was leased to Donald McLelland. Unfortunately, McLelland was bankrupt by
            1863 and in 1866 John Anderson, an agent from Glasgow takes over the lease.
        <blockquote>"There is not a whisky that gets a better reputation in the market." -Anderson</blockquote>
        In 1880, Roderick Kemp and Alexander Grigor Allan are brought in to take
        over the management of the disillery.
        <blockquote>"Whisky, in particular Talikser, is the King o'drinks as I conceive it."
            -R.L. Stevenson, writer
        </blockquote>
        Kemp moves on the Macallan distillery and Allan decides to merge with Thomas MacKenzie to form
        Dailuiane-Talisker Distillery in 1898. By 1900, Talisker has it's own pier, tramway,
        and worker housing.

        <p>In 1916, John Walker & Sons, along with John Dewar & Sons take over as a result of the
            death of MacKenzie. In 1941, Talisker shuts down, along with most distilleries,
            to conserve barley during the war. By 1960, the distillery was operating again,
            but lost it's stillhouse in a fire. In 1962, the stills were replaced and are
            still coal-fired today.
